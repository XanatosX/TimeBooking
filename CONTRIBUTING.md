Thank you for your interest in helping to develop this application

Please read the following document first before contributing.

## Developed with Github

The application is fully hosted on Github. It is used to track issues and feature requests.

All the builds created for you to download are created via Github actions.

## Requirements

You will need `node.js` and `npm` to run this project

* [node.js][nodeJs]
* [npm]

## The project is using [Git flow][GitFlow], so all the code changes happen via pull requests

Pull requests are the best way of changing the code. To create your own pull request follow those steps:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`
2. Check if the application runs on your machine without errors
3. Write your feature/bug fix
4. Check again if the application runs without error
   1. If possible check on another operation system
5. Create a [pull request][createPullRequest]
6. Wait until all the Github action tests are done and someone did review your code
7. Merge your branch and wait for a new unstable build ready to test

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

You can read the [license] on your own if you wish. In short, all the code for this application can be used without any reference in commercial and non commercial projects.

## Report a bug or request a feature

You did find a error, the application crashed or something feels wrong?
You do have a awesome idea which is a good addition to the application but you don't want or cannot write the code on your own?

Just create a [issue] or [feature request][issue]. Someone working on the project will pick your request up and try to solve it. Github will keep you updated on the state of your request.

### Tips for writing a request

Those tips will work for feature requests and bug reports.

* Add a quick summary what you have done
  * What have you clicked?
  * What happen?
  * What did you expect to happen?
* Write in your operation system
* Steps to reproduce
  * List all the steps we need to take to get the same error
* Notes do you have an idea what could be wrong or what caused it, please tell them to us.
